            <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
            <h5>Where are Patron Types found?</h5>
            <h6>Patron types can be found inside of the Patron menu. They can be accessed by selecting the Patron Type
                icon (<img src="img/patronTypeIcon.png" height="18" width="18">).</h6>
            <h5>Is sample data available?</h5>
            <h6>Yes. Sample data can be loaded through <code>File > Load Sample Data</code>.</h6>
            <h5>How does the automatic backup work?</h5>
            <h6>The automatic backup feature creates backups of all data files when data is modified and the user saves.
                This results in additional files being created inside the data directory. In the case that recovery is
                needed, an IT specialist is able to find the backup file with the data intact, and move them into a new
                directory and removing the suffixes from the end of the file name.</h6>
            <h5>Help! I cannot modify transactions!</h5>
            <h6>Transactions are unable to modified within the program to ensure integrity of the data. Transactions
                exist to maintain a record of all checked out and returned books within the system. Transactions may
                only be viewed within BookKeeper.</h6>
            <h5>Are graphs available in the reports view?</h5>
            <h6>Yes. There are many different graphs included, such as the
                <small>Book Status</small>
                and
                <small>Checkouts over Time</small>
                tabs, which include a pie chart of book statuses and a chart of book status over time.
            </h6>
            <h5>How can I access the interactive help (spotlight help)?</h5>
            <h6>Interactive help, also known as spotlight help, can be accessed through selecting the question mark icon
                (<img src="img/helpIcon.png" height="18" width="18">)

            <h5>What format does the data file use?</h5>
            <h6>The data file is based off a modified comma-separated-values (CSV) format. It separates different
